### Hi there 👋

I'm a digital craftsman focused on Ruby/Ruby on Rails development & front-end technologies. Have almost ten years of commercial experience in web application development.

I very much enjoy solving different problems & most happy when I’m creating meaningful experiences. Love creating products that help people.
